I entered the NFT space last April after rediscovering my own art.\n\nNow, I’m all in web3 selling my art as NFTs and helping projects scale.\n\nI joined the NFT space in April of 2021 as an artist and have a collection of 300 NFTs.\n\nMy artistic work is minted on my own $wonder contract by Manifold and platforms such as Makersplace, Foundation, OpenSea, Objkt.com, Versum, FxHash, Paras, and Exchange.art.\n\nI am also a community builder and helped build a couple early NFT communities like #famjam and #smolgang in 2021. Currently, I am working to build 0xTHULU.\n\nI aim to educate, empower, and uplift others through my platform and experience.","eventId":"base_event","twitter":"@wondermundo"}
