{"id":"jack_butcher","name":"Jack Butcher","bio":"I'm Jack. \n‍\nI spent 10 years working in Fortune 100 advertising in NYC as a designer, writer, strategist and art director for multi-billion dollar brands.\n‍\nFun, but the opposite of freedom.\n\nSo, in search of freedom, I started my own advertising agency. \n\nNo fun, and even less freedom.\n‍\nAfter two years of iteration, I figured out how to transition to highly-specialized (and fun) consulting, and a product business that serves 6,000 people around the world.\n‍\nThe insight behind this transition?\n\nProductizing myself.\n\nVisualize Value is the product of that transition, a project I've used to build a network of mentors, a $1M/year product business, and a media platform with an audience of over 700,000 people.\n‍\nIf you'd have told me this story 18 months ago, I wouldn't have believed you.\n\nNow I spend all of my time making things that make it easier to learn, teach, build, and sell.","eventId":"base_event","twitter":"@jackbutcher"}
