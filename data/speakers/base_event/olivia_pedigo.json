{"id":"olivia_pedigo","name":"Olivia Pedigo","bio":"Olivia Pedigo (b. 2000) is a Miami native 3D artist, animator, and graphic designer. Before graduating from the University of Florida in 2022 with a degree in Public Relations and a minor in Digital Arts and Sciences, Olivia gained experience as a gallery assistant at the Gainesville Fine Arts Association and as a merchandise designer for the on-campus publication Rowdy Magazine during her time in school.\n\nOver the past four years, Olivia's work has evolved to reflect a dreamscape where comfort and isolation intersect, notably seen in her 'bedroom pieces.' These scenes, devoid of human presence yet filled with character, explore the relationship between individuals and their possessions, with a focus on technology. She draws inspiration from childhood influences like Dr. Seuss and contemporary artists such as Jiayi Li, Nathalie Nguyen, and Hilma af Klint.\n\nIn early 2022, Olivia entered the web3 space, venturing into the world of NFTs. Since then, her work has found a home in hundreds of collections. Notable collectors include Terrell Jones, Vincent Van Dough, and Bongdoe. Her journey was highlighted in a feature by \"It's Nice That,\" a globally recognized platform for the creative community.\n\nOlivia has exhibited her creations at Lume Studios in New York City, NFTNYC 2023, and SHILLR's mobile gallery.","eventId":"base_event","twitter":"@oliviapedi"}
