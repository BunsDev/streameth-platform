With Celo transitioning to an L2 and validators transitioning to decentralized sequencers, this light client would transition to an efficient way to determine the Celo decentralized sequencer set on Ethereum.","start":1700302800000,"end":1700304000000,"stageId":"3b36","speakers":[{"id":"onur_kilic","name":"Onur Kilic","bio":"SNARK engineer @ EF & Celo","eventId":"light_client_summit","twitter":"@kiliconu","photo":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19mXSMwhIwtxFZ3bjtIXfujJXR_bhiYza"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"light_client_summit","coverImage":"/sessions/light_client_summit/verifying_celos_plumo_light_client_proofs_efficiently_on_ethereum_with_halo2.jpg"}
